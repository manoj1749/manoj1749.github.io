# MY EXPERIENCE DOING AMFOSS TASKS 😇

## A SMALL INTRODUCTION 😎
- Myself Manoj from Eluru,Andhra Pradesh
- I had studied PCM during my 11th & 12th such I don't come from a background of CS.
- I don't refer me as a tech geek myself, but I had some knowledge regarding how these machines work and all.
- My priority for amritapuri campus during counselling was only due to the amfoss club which I got to know through quora.

## MY EXPERIENCES 👨🏻‍💻
- It was a great experience for me.
- I had learnt many things in this process and done many tasks which at first I thought was not an easy task for a beginner like me.
- But I had managed to do some with the help of seniors🙂 
- Though I had faced some problems and errors during the process I had managed to complete the task succesfully ✌️.
- Compared to me at the position where I had started this task and the position in whicc I am there in the present I had learnt a lot of new things which was kinda a new and wonderful journey to me🙂.
